# New Pages
Before adding a new page, ensure that an existing page doesn't already cover the topic you're looking to work on. If there's overlap, see if it's more appropriate to add to an existing page rather than creating a new one. We should aim for the least number of pages we can while avoiding massive, lengthy pages of documentation.

If you'd still like to add a new page - great, go ahead and do it. Make sure you contact @codeHusky in the Redbox Tinkering Discord to have your new page added to the navigation. 

# Writing Tone and Style
All contributions should use a professional tone. Avoid using terms such as "I" or referring to yourself by any means. If you're documenting a technique you created, feel free to credit yourself, but credits for "discovering" things that exist in every kiosk isn't appropriate.
