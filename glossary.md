# VMZ
Vertical Merchandise Zone. On most units, the rotating carousel will have two posts of a noticable color (often yellow) to signify this zone. Intended for loading new discs into the unit.

# HAL
Hardware Abstraction Layer. In essence, a system used to interact with all of the physical hardware in the kiosk. Runs motors to turn carousel, run the picker up and down, and interfaces with all sensors inside each assembly. Also can control ventilation / air conditioning systems in some kiosks.

# KFC
Kiosk Function Check

# QLM
Unsure what this acronym means, but it appears to refer to the original method of loading/unloading Redbox kiosks back when the company was young. A door near the floor of the unit was used to load/unload discs from the unit.

# Thins
Discs that are scheduled to be removed from the kiosk. Think of it in terms of "thinning the herd"
