<p><strong>Redbox Desktop</strong> is an application accessible via a keyboard combination or by pressing the “Control Panel Log In” button from the <a href="/kioskengine/field-maintenance">Field Maintenance Application</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This application provides four categories of tools organized as: Kiosk, File System, Computer, and Setup. A list of all of the utilities can be found pictured below.</p>

<h1>Login Process</h1>
<p>To access the login screen press <code>CTRL+ALT+ENTER</code>Y after having a keyboard plugged into the computer inside the kiosk.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key combination works from almost anywhere on the kiosk, including when error messages are on screen. You should see “Please wait…” appear before the login screen appears. Note that this will fail if the kiosk is still booting up.</p>
<p>On machines that are Offline (all kiosks are), the login screen for the desktop (titled “Redbox Control Panel Login” will accept any credentials. No modifications are required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appears to be an intentional backdoor in the software to allow easy maintenance operations on the kiosk, even if the kiosk doesn't have an active connection to Redbox's services.</p>
